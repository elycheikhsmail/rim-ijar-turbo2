Based on my analysis, I can now present a comprehensive plan to fix the TypeScript issues after migrating from PostgreSQL to MongoDB. Here's the plan:

I've identified several type inconsistencies that need to be addressed after the migration from PostgreSQL to MongoDB. Here's the detailed plan to fix these issues:

Update Interface Types in app/types.ts:

Fix remaining number types to string for MongoDB ObjectId fields
Specifically in the Lieu interface:
moughataaId?: string; // Currently number
gpsLocationId?: string; // Currently number
Fix Handler Functions:

In handleGetAnnonces.ts:
Remove commented out parseInt(userId, 10) as we now use string IDs
Update type annotations for all ID parameters to string
Ensure all query parameters using IDs are passed as strings
Update Mock Data:

Review and update handleGetAnnonces.mocked.ts
Ensure all mocked IDs are valid MongoDB ObjectId strings
Update any hardcoded numeric IDs to string format
Type Definitions Clean-up:

Review all interfaces to ensure consistency with MongoDB types
Update any remaining number IDs to string
Add @db.ObjectId annotations where missing in schema
Ensure all foreign key fields use string types
Schema Validation:

Verify Prisma schema matches TypeScript interfaces
Ensure all ID fields are properly mapped with @db.ObjectId
Validate relationships are properly typed
Would you like me to proceed with implementing these changes? If so, please toggle to Act mode and I'll start making the necessary updates.

Note: This migration requires careful attention to maintain type safety while ensuring compatibility with MongoDB's ObjectId system. We'll need to update all ID-related code to handle string types instead of numbers.
